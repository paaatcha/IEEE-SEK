# IEEE Standard Educational Kits - IEEE SEK

This repository contains the codes related to the Latin American Robotics Competition (LARC). My team and I participated for 2 years of the IEEE - Standard Educational Kits category. The team was composed by me, Juan França, Ivan Oliveira, Vitor Buback and Jackson Brito. We all were Computer Engineering students at UFES.

This category is based on educational robotic kits. All competitors need to choose one kit and we aren't allowed to used anything beyond that. In both years we used the Lego Mindstorms kit. 

Every year the IEEE releases a new rule for a new challenge. Nonetheless, the essence of this category is to use **two autonomous robots that need to cooperate to solve a simulated problem**. You can check the competition's rules in [2010](https://github.com/paaatcha/IEEE-SEK/blob/master/larc2011/rules_sek_2011.pdf) and [2011](https://github.com/paaatcha/IEEE-SEK/blob/master/larc2010/rules_sek_2010.pdf). In 2010 the competition took place in São Paulo, Brazil and in 2011 in Bogotá, Colombia. In both competitions, **we got the 1st place** out of more than 20 teams.

The robots used light, touch and compass sensors. In addition, the used a bluetooth connection in order to communicate with each other. We programed them using a C-based-language called NXC.

You can see the robots' perfomance in 2010:
